A capstone to the forty-year career of a pioneer of panel data analysis, this new edition's primary contribution will be the coverage of advancements in panel data analysis, a statistical method widely used to analyze two or higher-dimensional panel data. The topics discussed in early editions have been reorganized and streamlined to comprehensively introduce panel econometric methodologies useful for identifying causal relationships among variables, supported by interdisciplinary examples and case studies. This book, to be featured in Cambridge's Econometric Society Monographs series, has been the leader in the field since the first edition. It is essential reading for researchers, practitioners and graduate students interested in the analysis of microeconomic behavior. },

We compare estimators based on VAR specifications determined by pretests for unit roots and cointegration as well as unrestricted VAR specifications in levels. Our main finding is that the impulse response estimators obtained from the levels specification tend to be most robust when the magnitude of the roots is not known. The pretest specification works well only when the restrictions imposed by the model are satisfied. Its performance deteriorates even for small deviations from the exact unit root for one or more model variables. We illustrate the practical relevance of our results through simulation examples and an empirical application. }

It is no good starting off a model with the kind of abstraction which initially excludes the influence of forces which are mainly responsible for the behaviour of the economic variables under investigation; and upon finding that the theory leads to results contrary to what we observe in reality, attributing this contrary movement to the compensating (or more than compensating) influence of residual factors that have been assumed away in the model. In dealing with capital accumulation and economic growth, we are only too apt to begin by assuming a ‘given state of knowledge’ (that is to say, absence of technical progress) and the absence of ‘uncertainty’, and content ourselves with saying that these two factors — technical progress and uncertainty — must have been responsible for the difference between theoretical expectation and the recorded facts of experience. The interpretative value of this kind of theory must of necessity be extremely small. },

The chapter begins by introducing DFMs and the associated statistical tools, both parametric (state-space forms) and nonparametric (principal components and related methods). After reviewing two mature applications of DFMs, forecasting and macroeconomic monitoring, the chapter lays out the use of DFMs for analysis of structural shocks, a special case of which is factor-augmented vector autoregressions (FAVARs). A main focus of the chapter is how to extend methods for identifying shocks in structural vector autoregression (SVAR) to structural DFMs. The chapter provides a unification of SVARs, FAVARs, and structural DFMs and shows both in theory and through an empirical application to oil shocks how the same identification strategies can be applied to each type of model. },

The paper analyzes the properties of least squares (LS) estimators in this context. The results of the paper allow for any form of cross-section dependence and heterogeneity across population units. The probability limits of the LS estimators are determined, and necessary and sufficient conditions are given for consistency. The asymptotic distributions of the estimators are found to be mixed normal after recentering and scaling. The t, Wald, and F statistics are found to have asymptotic standard normal, χ-super-2, and scaled χ-super-2 distributions, respectively, under the null hypothesis when the conditions required for consistency of the parameter under test hold. However, the absolute values of t, Wald, and F statistics are found to diverge to infinity under the null hypothesis when these conditions fail. Confidence intervals exhibit similarly dichotomous behavior. Hence, common shocks are found to be innocuous in some circumstances, but quite problematic in others.

Novel frequentist estimation methods are discussed by considering both a “partial shocks” identification strategy, where only g structural shocks are of interest and are instrumented, and a “full shocks” identification strategy, where despite g structural shocks being instrumented, all n=g+(n−g) structural shocks of the system can be identified under certain conditions. The suggested approach is applied to investigate empirically whether financial and macroeconomic uncertainty can be approximated as exogenous drivers of US real economic activity, or rather as endogenous responses to first moment shocks, or both. We analyze whether the dynamic causal effects of nonuncertainty shocks on macroeconomic and financial uncertainty are significant in the period after the global financial crisis. },

In the presence of multiple target shocks, test inversion techniques require extra restrictions on the proxy-SVAR parameters other than those implied by the proxies that may be difficult to interpret and test. We show that frequentist asymptotic inference in these situations can be conducted through Minimum Distance estimation and standard asymptotic methods if the proxy-SVAR can be identified by using ‘strong’ instruments for the non-target shocks; i.e., the shocks which are not of primary interest in the analysis. The suggested identification strategy hinges on a novel pre-test for the null of instrument relevance, based on bootstrap resampling, which is not subject to pre-testing issues. Specifically, the validity of post-test asymptotic inferences remains unaffected by the test outcomes due to an asymptotic independence result between the bootstrap and non-bootstrap statistics. The test is robust to conditionally heteroskedastic and/or zero-censored proxies, is computationally straightforward and applicable regardless of the number of shocks being instrumented. Some illustrative examples show the empirical usefulness of the suggested identification and testing strategy.},

This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O(T 2 ) for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks.

We consider identification, consistency, and the limiting distribution of the interactive-effects estimator. Under both large N and large T, the estimator is shown to be root(N T) consistent, which is valid in the presence of correlations and heteroskedasticities of unknown form in both dimensions.

The FECM combines error-correction, cointegration and dynamic factor models, and has several conceptual advantages over the standard ECM and FAVAR models. In particular, it uses a larger dataset than the ECM and incorporates the long-run information which the FAVAR is missing because of its specification in differences. In this paper, we examine the forecasting performance of the FECM by means of an analytical example, Monte Carlo simulations and several empirical applications. We show that FECM generally offers a higher forecasting precision relative to the FAVAR, and marks a useful step forward for forecasting with large datasets. },

	abstract = { This article deals with a variety of dynamic issues in the analysis of time-series–cross-section (TSCS) data. Although the issues raised are general, we focus on applications to comparative political economy, which frequently uses TSCS data. We begin with a discussion of specification and lay out the theoretical differences implied by the various types of dynamic models that can be estimated. It is shown that there is nothing pernicious in using a lagged dependent variable and that all dynamic models either implicitly or explicitly have such a variable; the differences between the models relate to assumptions about the speeds of adjustment of measured and unmeasured variables. When adjustment is quick, it is hard to differentiate between the various models; with slower speeds of adjustment, the various models make sufficiently different predictions that they can be tested against each other. As the speed of adjustment gets slower and slower, specification (and estimation) gets more and more tricky. We then turn to a discussion of estimation. It is noted that models with both a lagged dependent variable and serially correlated errors can easily be estimated; it is only ordinary least squares that is inconsistent in this situation. There is a brief discussion of lagged dependent variables combined with fixed effects and issues related to non-stationarity. We then show how our favored method of modeling dynamics combines nicely with methods for dealing with other TSCS issues, such as parameter heterogeneity and spatial dependence. We conclude with two examples. }

SpVARs may contain disturbances that are spatially as well as temporally correlated. Although the structural parameters are not fully identified in SpVARs, contemporaneous spatial lag coefficients may be identified by weakly exogenous state variables. Dynamic spatial panel data econometrics is used to estimate SpVARs. The incidental parameter problem is handled by bias correction rather than more popular alternatives such as generalised methods of moments (GMM). The interaction between temporal and spatial stationarity is discussed. The impulse responses for SpVARs are derived, which naturally depend upon the temporal and spatial dynamics of the model. We provide an empirical illustration using annual spatial panel data for Israel. The estimated SpVAR is used to calculate impulse responses between variables, over time, and across space. Finally, weakly exogenous instrumental variables are used to identify contemporaneous spatial lag coefficients. },

	abstract = { Structural vector autoregressions (VARs) are widely used to trace out the effect of monetary policy innovations on the economy. However, the sparse information sets typically used in these empirical models lead to at least three potential problems with the results. First, to the extent that central banks and the private sector have information not reflected in the VAR, the measurement of policy innovations is likely to be contaminated. Second, the choice of a specific data series to represent a general economic concept such as "real activity" is often arbitrary to some degree. Third, impulse responses can be observed only for the included variables, which generally constitute only a small subset of the variables that the researcher and policy-maker care about. In this paper we investigate one potential solution to this limited information problem, which combines the standard structural VAR analysis with recent developments in factor analysis for large data sets. We find that the information that our factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) methodology exploits is indeed important to properly identify the monetary transmission mechanism. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive and coherent picture of the effect of monetary policy on the economy. },

A joint central limit theorem for the LS estimators of both the VAR slope parameters as well as the unconditional innovation variance parameters is obtained from a weak vector autoregressive moving average model set-up recently proposed in the literature. Our results are important for correct inference on VAR statistics that depend both on the VAR slope and the variance parameters as e.g. in structural impulse responses. We also show that wild and pairwise bootstrap schemes fail in the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity if inference on (functions) of the unconditional variance parameters is of interest because they do not correctly replicate the relevant fourth moments’ structure of the innovations. In contrast, the residual-based moving block bootstrap results in asymptotically valid inference. We illustrate the practical implications of our theoretical results by providing simulation evidence on the finite sample properties of different inference methods for impulse response coefficients. Our results point out that estimation uncertainty may increase dramatically in the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity. Moreover, most inference methods are likely to understate the true estimation uncertainty substantially in finite samples. },

A Monte Carlo experiment shows that incorporating the cointegration structure into the DFM leads to a better reconstruction of the space spanned by the factors, compared to the most standard technique of applying a factor model in differenced systems. We apply our procedure to a set of commodity prices to analyse the co-movement among different markets and find that commodity prices move together mostly due to long-term common forces; while the trend for the prices of most primary goods is declining, metals and energy exhibit an upward or at least stable pattern since the 2000s. },

	abstract = { ‘Fat big data’ characterise data sets that contain many more variables than observations. We discuss the use of both principal components analysis and equilibrium correction models to identify cointegrating relations that handle stochastic trends in non-stationary fat data. However, most time series are wide-sense non-stationary—induced by the joint occurrence of stochastic trends and distributional shifts—so we also handle the latter by saturation estimation. Seeking substantive relationships when there are vast numbers of potentially spurious connections cannot be achieved by merely choosing the best-fitting equation or trying hundreds of empirical fits and selecting a preferred one, perhaps contradicted by others that go unreported. Conversely, fat big data are useful if they help ensure that the data generation process is nested in the postulated model, and increase the power of specification and mis-specification tests without raising the chances of adventitious significance. We model the monthly UK unemployment rate, using both macroeconomic and Google Trends data, searching across 3000 explanatory variables, yet identify a parsimonious, statistically valid, and theoretically interpretable specification. }

A number of bootstrap procedures have been proposed in the recent literature some of which include estimated deterministic components and nonzero initial values in the bootstrap recursion while others do the opposite. To date, however, there has not been a study into the relative performance of these two alternative approaches. In this paper we fill this gap in the literature and consider the impact of these choices on both ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) detrended tests, in the case of the latter proposing a new bootstrap algorithm as part of our analysis. Overall, for OLS detrended tests our findings suggest that it is preferable to take the computationally simpler approach of not including estimated deterministic components in the bootstrap recursion and setting the initial values of the bootstrap recursion to zero. For GLS detrended tests, we find that the approach of Trenkler (2009), who includes a restricted estimate of the deterministic component in the bootstrap recursion, can improve finite sample behavior further. },

	abstract = { In a recent paper Cavaliere et al. (2012) develop bootstrap implementations of the (pseudo-) likelihood ratio (PLR) co-integration rank test and associated sequential rank determination procedure of Johansen (1996). The bootstrap samples are constructed using the restricted parameter estimates of the underlying vector autoregressive (VAR) model which obtain under the reduced rank null hypothesis. They propose methods based on an independent and individual distributed (i.i.d.) bootstrap resampling scheme and establish the validity of their proposed bootstrap procedures in the context of a co-integrated VAR model with i.i.d. innovations. In this paper we investigate the properties of their bootstrap procedures, together with analogous procedures based on a wild bootstrap resampling scheme, when time-varying behavior is present in either the conditional or unconditional variance of the innovations. We show that the bootstrap PLR tests are asymptotically correctly sized and, moreover, that the probability that the associated bootstrap sequential procedures select a rank smaller than the true rank converges to zero. This result is shown to hold for both the i.i.d. and wild bootstrap variants under conditional heteroskedasticity but only for the latter under unconditional heteroskedasticity. Monte Carlo evidence is reported which suggests that the bootstrap approach of Cavaliere et al. (2012) significantly improves upon the finite sample performance of corresponding procedures based on either the asymptotic PLR test or an alternative bootstrap method (where the short run dynamics in the VAR model are estimated unrestrictedly) for a variety of conditionally and unconditionally heteroskedastic innovation processes. },

As a consequence, the ratio between variances and the dynamic dependence of the common and idiosyncratic differentiated components may change with respect to the original components. In this paper, we analyze the effects of these changes on the finite sample properties of several procedures to determine the number of factors. In particular, we consider the information criteria of Bai and Ng (Econometrica 70(1):191–221, 2002), the edge distribution of Onatski (Rev Econ Stat 92(4):1004–1016, 2010) and the ratios of eigenvalues proposed by Ahn and Horenstein (Econometrica 81(3):1203–1227, 2013). The performance of these procedures when implemented to differentiated variables depends on both the ratios between variances and dependencies of the differentiated factor and idiosyncratic noises. Furthermore, we also analyze the role of the number of factors in the original non-stationary system as well as of its temporal and cross-sectional dimensions. Finally, we implement the different procedures to determine the number of common factors in a system of inflation rates in 15 euro area countries.},

This paper shows that these restrictions are equivalent to a set of restrictions that are applied in the methods of Gonzalo and Ng and King et al. (KPSW). Using this result, it is shown that the Pagan and Pesaran method can be used to recover the structural shocks with permanent effects identically to those from the Gonzalo and Ng and KPSW methods. In the former case, this is illustrated in the context of Lettau and Ludvigson's consumption model and in the latter case in KPSW's six variable model.

First, we provide a formal treatment of partial fundamentalness-that is, the idea that a structural vector autoregression (VAR) can recover, either exactly or with good approximation, a single shock or a subset of shocks, even when the underlying model is nonfundamental. In particular, we extend the measure of partial fundamentalness proposed by Sims and Zha to the finite‐order case and study the implications of partial fundamentalness for impulse‐response and variance‐decomposition analysis. Second, we present an application where we validate a theory of news shocks and find it to be in line with the empirical evidence. },

We apply a novel data-based identification approach of the structural shocks that allows to account for the complex interrelations within the triad of exchange rates, sovereign risks and interest rates. The direction and size of the response of sovereign risk to FX rate movements depend on the considered type of exchange rate measure and on the size of the net foreign currency exposure of an economy. A depreciation of the domestic currency against the USD increases sovereign risk. In contrast, when looking at the nominal effective exchange rate that is unrelated to changes of USD exchange rate, we find in general no significant effect. We conclude that the ‘financial channel’is more important in the transmission of exchange rate shocks to sovereign risk in comparison with the traditional ‘net trade channel’. Moreover, we confirm the prime role of the currency mismatch of the non-public sector for the strength of the ‘financial channel’. },

Two approaches to modeling cross-sectional dependence in economic panel data are often used: the spatial dependence approach, which explains cross-sectional dependence in terms of distance among units, and the residual multifactor approach, which explains cross-sectional dependence by common factors that affect individuals to a different extent. This article reviews the theory on estimation and statistical inference for stationary and nonstationary panel data with cross-sectional dependence, particularly for models with a multifactor error structure. Tests and diagnostics for testing for unit roots, slope homogeneity, cointegration, and the number of factors are provided. We discuss issues such as estimating common factors, dealing with parameter plethora in practice, testing for structural stability and nonlinearity, and dealing with model and parameter uncertainty. Finally, we address issues related to the use of these economic panel models. },

Several studies have recently addressed this issue for panel unit-root tests using a common factor structure to model the cross-sectional dependence, but not much work has been done yet for panel no-cointegration tests. This paper proposes a model for panel no-cointegration using an unobserved common factor structure, following the study by Bai and Ng [Econometrica (2004), Vol. 72, pp. 1127–1177] for panel unit roots. We distinguish two important cases: (i) the case when the non-stationarity in the data is driven by a reduced number of common stochastic trends, and (ii) the case where we have common and idiosyncratic stochastic trends present in the data. We discuss the homogeneity restrictions on the cointegrating vectors resulting from the presence of common factor cointegration. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behaviour of some existing residual-based panel no-cointegration tests, as suggested by Kao [Journal of Econometrics (1999), Vol. 90, pp. 1–44] and Pedroni [Econometric Theory (2004a), Vol. 20, pp. 597–625]. Under the data-generating processes (DGP) used, the test statistics are no longer asymptotically normal, and convergence occurs at rate T rather than as for independent panels. We then examine the possibilities of testing for various forms of no-cointegration by extracting the common factors and individual components from the observed data directly and then testing for no-cointegration using residual-based panel tests applied to the defactored data.}

The aim of our paper is to derive the asymptotic properties of the PML approaches, in particular to study their consistency. We conduct Monte Carlo studies exploring the relative performances of these methods.

We apply our approach to a fiscal VAR for the United States over 1948–2019, where the overidentifying restrictions are not rejected. The overidentified structural vector autoregression (SVAR) yields (a) greater precision in estimating impulse response functions and multipliers and (b) measures of the effects of nonfiscal shocks even when there is no instrument for them. },

The relevance of super exogeneity to S-ancillary statistics is reexamined from a theoretical viewpoint, and it is then argued that the small-sample precision of statistical inference for cointegrating parameters can be improved by conditioning on a class of super exogenous variables. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical argument. An empirical analysis is also performed as a demonstration of the practicality of the argument. }

The availability of data sets with large temporal and cross-sectional dimensions suggests the possibility of new resampling schemes. We suggest one possibility which has not been widely explored in the literature. It amounts to constructing bootstrap samples by resampling whole cross-sectional units with replacement. In cases where the data do not exhibit cross-sectional dependence but exhibit temporal dependence, such a resampling scheme is of great interest as it allows the application of i.i.d. bootstrap resampling rather than block bootstrap resampling. It is well known that the former enables superior approximation to distributions of statistics compared to the latter. We prove that the bootstrap based on cross-sectional resampling provides asymptotic refinements. A Monte Carlo study illustrates the superior properties of the new resampling scheme compared to the block bootstrap. Copyright © 2008 The Author. Journal compilation Royal Economic Society 2008 },

Building upon this result, we introduce an identification scheme under which the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters of the non-Gaussian SVAR model is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. As a consequence, additional economic identifying restrictions can be tested. In an empirical application, we find a negative impact of a contractionary monetary policy shock on financial markets, and clearly reject the commonly employed recursive identifying restrictions.},

This paper introduces an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and the number of variables go to infinity together.

So far there are no techniques for validating the shocks identified via such restrictions. Although in an ideal setting the sign restrictions specify shocks of interest, sign restrictions may be invalidated by measurement errors, data adjustments or omitted variables. We model changes in the volatility of the shocks via a Markov switching (MS) mechanism and use this device to give the data a chance to object to sign restrictions. The approach is illustrated by considering a small model for the market of crude oil. Earlier findings that oil supply shocks explain only a very small fraction of movements in the price of oil are confirmed and it is found that the importance of aggregate demand shocks for oil price movements has declined since the mid 1980s. },

Therefore we propose a model based on a smooth change in variance that is flexible as well as relatively easy to estimate and illustrate its use by analysis of the interaction between monetary policy and the stock market based on a five-dimensional system of U.S. variables. For the benchmark setup it is found that previously used conventional identification schemes in this context are rejected by the data if heteroskedasticity is allowed for.

Allowable heterogeneity across individuals include individual‐specific time trends, individual‐specific fixed effects and time‐specific effects. The estimator is fully parametric, computationally convenient, and more precise than the single equation estimator. For fixed N as T→∞, the estimator converges to a function of Brownian motions and the Wald statistic for testing a set of s linear constraints has a limiting χ2(s) distribution. The estimator also has a Gaussian sequential limit distribution that is obtained first by letting T→∞ and then letting N→∞. In a series of Monte‐Carlo experiments, we find that the asymptotic distribution theory provides a reasonably close approximation to the exact finite sample distribution. We use panel DOLS to estimate coefficients of the long‐run money demand function from a panel of 19 countries with annual observations that span from 1957 to 1996. The estimated income elasticity is 1.08 (asymptotic s.e. = 0.26) and the estimated interest rate semi‐elasticity is −0.02 (asymptotic s.e. = 0.01). },

We propose methodology for estimating mutually independent components, and a versatile resampling-based procedure for inference, including misspecification testing. Independent components are estimated by combining a nonparametric probability integral transformation with a generalized nonparametric whitening method based on distance covariance that simultaneously minimizes all forms of dependence among the components. We prove the consistency of our estimator under minimal regularity conditions and detail conditions for consistency under model misspecification, all while placing assumptions on the observations directly, not on the latent components. U statistics of certain Euclidean distances between sample elements are combined to construct a test statistic for mutually independent components. The proposed measures and tests are based on both necessary and sufficient conditions for mutual independence. We demonstrate the improvements of the proposed method over several competing methods in simulation studies, and we apply the proposed ICA approach to two real examples and contrast it with principal component analysis. },

So-called independence based identification provides unique structural shocks (up to scaling and ordering) under the assumption of at most one Gaussian component. While non-Gaussianity of certain interesting shocks appears rather natural, not all macroeconomic shocks in the system might show this clear difference from Gaussianity. Identifiability can be generalized by noting that even in the presence of multiple Gaussian shocks the non-Gaussian ones are still unique. Consequently, independence based identification allows to uniquely determine the (non-Gaussian) shocks of interest irrespective of the distribution of the remaining system. Furthermore, studying settings close to normality or with multiple Gaussian components highlights the performance of normality diagnostics and their applicability to decide on the identifiability of the structural shock components. In an illustrative five dimensional model the identified monetary policy and stock price shock confirm the results of previous studies on the monetary policy asset price nexus.},

Theoretical cointegration vectors are derived from a small open economy growth model for terms of trade, real GDP, real consumption. and real investments.

In contrast, rising private debt has a milder positive impact on gross domestic product, but it fades out over time.

The main result of the paper is that under certain assumptions, the limiting distribution of the LS estimator is independent of the number of factors used in the estimation as long as this number is not underestimated.

Unlike earlier work in this area, our empirical methodology avoids making arbitrary assumptions about the relevant policy indicator or transmission mechanism in order to achieve identification. At the same time, it allows us to assess the implications of imposing invalid identifying restrictions. Our results indicate that the nominal exchange rate exhibits delayed overshooting in response to a monetary expansion, depreciating for roughly ten months before starting to appreciate. The shock also leads to large and persistent departures from uncovered interest rate parity.

Asymptotic validity of the bootstrap tests is established in very general settings, including the presence of common factors and cointegration across units. Properties under the alternative hypothesis are also considered.

The method appears to do remarkably well at uncovering the properties of the sample distribution of the underlying structural dynamics, even when the panels are relatively short, as illustrated in Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, these simulations also illustrate that the SVAR panel method can be used to improve inference, not only for properties of the sample distribution, but also for dynamics of individual members of the panel that lack adequate data for a conventional time series SVAR analysis. This is accomplished by using fitted cross sectional regressions of the sample of estimated panel responses to correlated static measures, and using these to interpolate the member-specific dynamics.},

It introduces a general framework where error cross-section dependence may arise because of unobserved common effects and/or error spill-over effects due to spatial or other forms of local dependencies. Initially, this paper focuses on a panel regression model where the idiosyncratic errors are spatially dependent and possibly serially correlated, and derives the asymptotic distributions of the mean group and pooled estimators under heterogeneous and homogeneous slope coefficients, and for these estimators proposes non-parametric variance matrix estimators. The paper then considers the more general case of a panel data model with a multifactor error structure and spatial error correlations. Under this framework, the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) estimator, recently advanced by Pesaran (2006), continues to yield estimates of the slope coefficients that are consistent and asymptotically normal. Small sample properties of the estimators under various patterns of cross-section dependence, including spatial forms, are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments. Results show that the CCE approach works well in the presence of weak and/or strong cross-sectionally correlated errors. },

We establish consistency rates, derive the asymptotic distribution, suggest using covariates to deal with the effects of multiple unobserved common factors, and consider jackknife and recursive de-meaning bias correction procedures to mitigate the small sample time series bias.

The unobserved factors and the individual-specific errors are allowed to follow arbitrary stationary processes, and the number of unobserved factors need not be estimated. The basic idea is to filter the individual-specific regressors by means of cross-section averages such that asymptotically as the cross-section dimension (N) tends to infinity, the differential effects of unobserved common factors are eliminated. The estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by least squares applied to auxiliary regressions where the observed regressors are augmented with cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and the individual-specific regressors. A number of estimators (referred to as common correlated effects (CCE) estimators) are proposed and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The small sample properties of mean group and pooled CCE estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, showing that the CCE estimators have satisfactory small sample properties even under a substantial degree of heterogeneity and dynamics, and for relatively small values of N and T.

Recently, work by Pesaran (2006) has suggested a method which makes use of cross-sectional averages to provide valid inference in the case of stationary panel regressions with a multifactor error structure. This paper extends this work and examines the important case where the unobservable common factors follow unit root processes. The extension to I(1) processes is remarkable on two counts. First, it is of great interest to note that while intermediate results needed for deriving the asymptotic distribution of the panel estimators differ between the I(1) and I(0) cases, the final results are surprisingly similar. This is in direct contrast to the standard distributional results for I(1) processes that radically differ from those for I(0) processes. Second, it is worth noting the significant extra technical demands required to prove the new results. The theoretical findings are further supported for small samples via an extensive Monte Carlo study. In particular, the results of the Monte Carlo study suggest that the cross-sectional-average-based method is robust to a wide variety of data generation processes and has lower biases than the alternative estimation methods considered in the paper. },

It is found that IV regressions are consistent even when the instruments are stochastically independent of the regressors. This phenomenon, which contrasts with traditional theory for stationary time series, is a beneficial artifact of spurious regression theory whereby stochastic trends in the instruments ensure their relevance asymptotically. Problems of inference are also addressed and some promising new theoretical results are reported. These involve a class of Wald tests which are modified by semiparametric corrections for serial correlation and for endogeneity. The resulting test statistics which we term fully-modified Wald tests have limiting X2 distributions, thereby removing the obstacles to inference in cointegrated systems that were presented by the nuisance parameter dependencies in earlier work. Some simulation results are reported which seek to explore the sampling behaviour of our suggested procedures. These simulations compare our fully modified (semiparametric) methods with the parametric error-correction methodology that has been extensively used in recent empirical research and with conventional least squares regression. Both the fully-modified and errorcorrection methods work well in finite samples and the sampling performance of each procedure confirms the relevance of asymptotic distribution theory, as distinct from super-consistency results, in discriminating between statistical methods. },

Econometric modelling allows us to quantify these impacts and their uncertainties, but models have to be consistent with the underlying physics and the time series properties of the data. Here I show that energy-balance models of climate are equivalent to an econometric cointegrated system and can be estimated in discrete time. This equivalence provides a basis for the use of cointegration methods to estimate climate responses and test their feedback. Further, it is possible to use the estimated parameters to quantify uncertainties in integrated assessment models of the economic impacts of climate change. In an application I estimate a system of temperatures, ocean heat content, and radiative forcing including greenhouse gases, and find statistical support for the cointegrated energy balance model. Accounting for structural breaks from volcanic eruptions highlights large parameter uncertainties and shows that previous empirical estimates of the temperature response to increased CO2 concentrations may be misleadingly low due to model-misspecification. },

Changes can occur in the regression coefficients and/or the covariance matrix of the errors. We also allow arbitrary restrictions on these parameters, which permits the analysis of partial structural change models, common breaks that occur in all equations, breaks that occur in a subset of equations, and so forth. The method of estimation is quasi-maximum likelihood based on Normal errors. The limiting distributions are obtained under more general assumptions than previous studies. For testing, we propose likelihood ratio type statistics to test the null hypothesis of no structural change and to select the number of changes. Structural change tests with restrictions on the parameters can be constructed to achieve higher power when prior information is present. For computation, an algorithm for an efficient procedure is proposed to construct the estimates and test statistics. We also introduce a novel locally ordered breaks model, which allows the breaks in different equations to be related yet not occurring at the same dates. Copyright The Econometric Society 2007.},

With a view to providing guidance to applied researchers on how to pool in a panel-VAR, this paper compares the performance of the FE and the MG estimators both asymptotically and in Monte Carlo simulations. The main results of the analysis suggest the use of both estimators in applied work. If FE and MG estimates give similar estimates, the FE estimator should be used because it is more efficient. If they differ, the MG estimator should be used only if the panel is sufficiently long -- say, twice as long as usually recommended in the dynamic panel data literature. If FE and MG estimates differ and the panel is not long enough, neither is generally a desirable alternative and other estimation techniques are needed.},

ICA is a popular method with diverse applications including artifact removal in electrophysiology data, feature extraction in microarray data, and identifying brain networks in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). ICA can be viewed as a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) that takes into account higher-order cross-correlations. Whereas the PCA solution is unique, there are many ICA methods-whose solutions may differ. Infomax, FastICA, and JADE are commonly applied to fMRI studies, with FastICA being arguably the most popular. Hastie and Tibshirani (2003) demonstrated that ProDenICA outperformed FastICA in simulations with two components. We introduce the application of ProDenICA to simulations with more components and to fMRI data. ProDenICA was more accurate in simulations, and we identified differences between biologically meaningful ICs from ProDenICA versus other methods in the fMRI analysis. ICA methods require nonconvex optimization, yet current practices do not recognize the importance of, nor adequately address sensitivity to, initial values. We found that local optima led to dramatically different estimates in both simulations and group ICA of fMRI, and we provide evidence that the global optimum from ProDenICA is the best estimate. We applied a modification of the Hungarian (Kuhn-Munkres) algorithm to match ICs from multiple estimates, thereby gaining novel insights into how brain networks vary in their sensitivity to initial values and ICA method. },

Moreover, when nonlinear identifying restrictions are used, no efficient algorithms exist for small-sample estimation and inference. This paper makes four contributions towards filling these important gaps in the literature. First, we establish general rank conditions for global identification of both identified and exactly identified models. These rank conditions are sufficient for general identification and are necessary and sufficient for exact identification. Second, we show that these conditions can be easily implemented and that they apply to a wide class of identifying restrictions, including linear and certain nonlinear restrictions. Third, we show that the rank condition for exactly identified models amounts to a straightforward counting exercise. Fourth, we develop efficient algorithms for small-sample estimation and inference, especially for SVARs with nonlinear restrictions. Copyright , Wiley-Blackwell.},

The theory applies to a reasonably wide class of estimators without making any specific assumptions about the probability distribution or short-run dynamics of the data-generating process. Due to the nonstandard nature of the estimation problem, the conventional minimum variance criterion does not provide a convenient measure of asymptotic efficiency. An alternative criterion, based on the concentration or peakedness of the limiting distribution of an estimator, is therefore adopted. The limiting distribution of estimators with maximum asymptotic efficiency is characterized in the paper and used to discuss the optimality of some known estimators. A new asymptotically efficient estimator is also introduced. This estimator is obtained from the ordinary least-squares estimator by a time domain correction which is nonparametric in the sense that no assumption of a finite parameter model is required. The estimator can be computed with least squares without any initial estimations. },

It is shown that, under such circumstances, the standard moment conditions used by these estimators are invalid -- a result that holds for any lag length of the instruments used. Transforming the data in terms of deviations from time-specific averages helps to reduce the asymptotic bias of the estimators, unless the factor loadings have mean zero. The finite sample behaviour of IV and GMM estimators is investigated by means of Monte Carlo experiments. The results suggest that the bias of these estimators can be severe to the extent that the standard fixed effects estimator is not generally inferior anymore in terms of root median square error. Time-specific demeaning alleviates the problem, although the effectiveness of this transformation decreases when the variance of the factor loadings is large. },

Finite sample performance is investigated via a Monte Carlo experiment.

We begin with a discussion of the implications of whether energy variables contain a unit root and proceed to examine how results differ according to the specific unit root or stationarity test employed. We then proceed to examine recent developments in the literature on cointegration, Granger causality and long-run estimates between (disaggregated) energy consumption and economic growth. We review both single country and panel studies and pay particular attention to studies which have expanded the literature through adding variables such as financial development and trade, in addition to energy consumption to the augmented production function, as well as studies which have extended the literature through examining disaggregated energy consumption by type. In each case we highlight best practice in the literature, point to limitations in the literature, including econometric modeling challenges, and suggest recommendations for future research. A key message of our survey is that the profession needs to guard against ‘overload’ of research in these areas as most applied studies are no longer adding anything more to what is already known. },

The panel VAR model in question is flexible in that it can accommodate an arbitrary lag length and observable regressors that can be individual-specific or common. For factor VAR models with both a large cross-section (C) and a large time (T) dimension, we derive the limiting distribution of the interactive fixed estimator, allowing structural analysis to be extended to panel VAR models with interactive fixed effects. },

	abstract = { Policy analysis had long been a main interest of Clive Granger’s. Here, we present a framework for economic policy analysis that provides a novel integration of several fundamental concepts at the heart of Granger’s contributions to time-series analysis. We work with a dynamic structural system analyzed by White and Lu (2010) with well defined causal meaning; under suitable conditional exogeneity restrictions, Granger causality coincides with this structural notion. The system contains target and control subsystems, with possibly integrated or cointegrated behavior. We ensure the invariance of the target subsystem to policy interventions using an explicitly causal partial equilibrium recursivity condition. Policy effectiveness is ensured by another explicit causality condition. These properties only involve the data generating process; models play a subsidiary role. Our framework thus complements that of Ericsson et al. (1998) (EHM) by providing conditions for policy analysis alternative to weak, strong, and superexogeneity. This makes possible policy analysis for systems that may fail EHM’s conditions. It also facilitates analysis of the cointegrating properties of systems subject to policymaker control. We discuss a variety of practical procedures useful for analyzing such systems and illustrate with an application to a simple model of the US macroeconomy. },

As expected, the test performance is very sensitive to the value of the stationary root(s) of the process. We also find that the test performance depends crucially on the correlation between the innovations that drive the stationary and the nonstationary components of the process.

The first approach, commonly used in practice, uses a break test as a specification check after the lag length is selected by an information criterion. The second performs the break test prior to estimating the lag length. The third simultaneously selects both the lag length and the break by some information criterion. While the latter two approaches are consistent for the true lag order, we justify the validity of the first approach by showing that the lag length estimator based on specific information criteria is at worst biased upwards asymptotically when the mean break is ignored. Thus, conditional on the estimated lag length, the break test retains its asymptotic power properties. Finite-sample simulation results show that the second approach tends to have the most stable performance. The results also indicate that the best strategy for short-run forecasting does not necessarily coincide with the best strategy for finding the correct model. },

	type = {{MPRA Paper}},
	abstract = { This paper considers dynamic panel models with a factor error structure that is correlated with the regressors. Both short panels (small T) and long panels (large T) are considered. With a small T, consistent estimation requires either a suitable formulation of the reduced form or an appropriate conditional equation for the first observation. Also needed is a suitable control for the correlation between the effects and the regressors. Under the factor error structure, the panel system implies parameter constraints between the mean vector and the covariance matrix. We explore the constraints through a quasi-FIML approach. The factor process is treated as parameters and it can have arbitrary dynamics under both fixed and large T. The large T setting involves incidental parameters because the number of parameters (including the time effects, the factor process, the heteroskedasticity parameters) increases with T. Even though an increasing number of parameters are estimated, we show that there is no incidental parameters bias to affect the limiting distributions; the estimator is centered at zero even scaled by the fast convergence rate of root-NT. We also show that the quasi-FIML approach is efficient under both fixed and large T, despite non-normality, heteroskedasticity, and incidental parameters. Finally we develop a feasible and fast algorithm for computing the quasi-FIML estimators under interactive effects. },

	abstract = {This paper proposes a regularisation method for the estimation of large covariance matrices that uses insights from the multiple testing ( MT ) literature. The approach tests the statistical significance of individual pair-wise correlations and sets to zero those elements that are not statistically significant, taking account of the multiple testing nature of the problem. By using the inverse of the normal distribution at a predetermined significance level, it circumvents the challenge of estimating the theoretical constant arising in the rate of convergence of existing thresholding estimators, and hence it is easy to implement and does not require cross-validation. The MT estimator of the sample correlation matrix is shown to be consistent in the spectral and Frobenius norms, and in terms of support recovery, so long as the true covariance matrix is sparse. The performance of the proposed MT estimator is compared to a number of other estimators in the literature using Monte Carlo experiments. It is shown that the MT estimator performs well and tends to outperform the other estimators, particularly when the cross section dimension, N , is larger than the time series dimension, T .},

In this paper we investigate these issues in the context of non-stationary panels with multifactor error structure, employing Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the distributions and rejection frequencies for standard time-series diagnostic procedures, including tests for residual autocorrelation, ARCH, normality, heteroskedasticity and functional form.},

	abstract = { We develop methodology for estimation and inference using machine learning to enrich economic models. Our framework takes a standard economic model and recasts the parameters as fully flexible nonparametric functions, to capture the rich heterogeneity based on potentially high dimensional or complex observable characteristics. These "parameter functions" retain the interpretability, economic meaning, and discipline of classical parameters. Deep learning is particularly well-suited to structured modeling of heterogeneity in economics. We show how to design the network architecture to match the structure of the economic model, delivering novel methodology that moves deep learning beyond prediction. We prove convergence rates for the estimated parameter functions. These functions are the key inputs into the finite-dimensional parameter of inferential interest. We obtain inference based on a novel influence function calculation that covers any second-stage parameter and any machine-learning-enriched model that uses a smooth per-observation loss function. No additional derivations are required. The score can be taken directly to data, using automatic differentiation if needed. The researcher need only define the original model and define the parameter of interest. A key insight is that we need not write down the influence function in order to evaluate it on the data. Our framework gives new results for a host of contexts, covering such diverse examples as price elasticities, willingness-to-pay, and surplus measures in binary or multinomial choice models, effects of continuous treatment variables, fractional outcome models, count data, heterogeneous production functions, and more. We apply our methodology to a large scale advertising experiment for short-term loans. We show how economically meaningful estimates and inferences can be made that would be unavailable without our results. },

Statistical data characteristics (e.g, heteroskedasticity or non-Gaussian independent components) allow for unique identification. Studying distinct covariance changes and distributional frameworks, we compare alternative data-driven identification procedures and identification by means of sign restrictions. The application of sign restrictions results in estimation biases as a reflection of censored sampling from a space of covariance decompositions. Statistical identification schemes are robust under distinct data structures to some extent. The detection of independent components appears most flexible unless the underlying shocks are (close to) Gaussianity. For analyzing linkages among the US business cycle and distinct sources of uncertainty we benefit from simulation-based evidence to point at two most suitable identification schemes. We detect a unidirectional effect of financial uncertainty on real economic activity and mutual causality between macroeconomic uncertainty and business cycles. },

This limiting distribution is characterized, and the estimator is shown to be asymptotically biased when the proxy variable is weak. The F statistic from the projection of the proxy variable onto the VAR errors can be used to test for a weak proxy variable, and the critical values for different VAR dimensions, levels of asymptotic bias, and levels of statistical significance are provided. An important feature of this F statistic is that its asymptotic distribution does not depend on parameters that need to be estimated. },

	abstract	= { This paper describes a method for estimating panels by imposing a factor structure on the residuals. The method allows SUR estimation of panel models by providing a full-rank estimator of the system covariance matrix when the usual estimate is rank-deficient. We charactersie completely the circumstances when this is possible. When the usual estimator is of full rank, our procedure provides a more parsimonious representation of the covariance matrix, which can lead to efficiency gains in finite samples. Monte Carlo analysis of convergence regressions and PPP regressions in the Heston-Summers data-set indicates that the proposed estimator has better performance in terms of RMSE and bias than standard panel or SUR estimators (where available), as well as offering unbiased inference. },

	abstract={ This paper considers VAR models incorporating many time series that interact through a few dynamic factors. Several econometric issues are addressed including estimation of the number of dynamic factors and tests for the factor restrictions imposed on the VAR. Structural VAR identification based on timing restrictions, long run restrictions, and restrictions on factor loadings are discussed and practical computational methods suggested. Empirical analysis using U.S. data suggest several (7) dynamic factors, rejection of the exact dynamic factor model but support for an approximate factor model, and sensible results for a SVAR that identifies money policy shocks using timing restrictions. },

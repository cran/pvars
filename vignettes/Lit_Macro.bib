We apply the methodology for non-stationary panels, which allows for cross-sectional dependence. We also choose the timespan of data free of high inflation periods and focus on countries with relatively flexible exchange rates. Using quarterly panel data, 2001:4–2012:4, we find evidence of cointegration between exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals. Granger causality tests reveal that exchange rates have reverted to the long-run relation implied by the monetary model. The results obtained are not driven by the recent crisis. }

Two results stand out: (1) the estimated conditional correlations of hours and productivity are negative for technology shocks, positive for nontechnology shocks; and (2) hours show a persistent decline in response to a positive technology shock. Most of the results hold for a variety of model specifications and for the majority of G7 countries. The picture that emerges is hard to reconcile with a conventional real-business-cycle interpretation of business cycles but is shown to be consistent with a simple model with monopolistic competition and sticky prices.},

	number = {4},
	pages = {pp. 469-486},
	abstract = { The notion of green growth has emerged as a dominant policy response to climate change and ecological breakdown. Green growth theory asserts that continued economic expansion is compatible with our planet’s ecology, as technological change and substitution will allow us to absolutely decouple GDP growth from resource use and carbon emissions. This claim is now assumed in national and international policy, including in the Sustainable Development Goals. But empirical evidence on resource use and carbon emissions does not support green growth theory. Examining relevant studies on historical trends and model-based projections, we find that: (1) there is no empirical evidence that absolute decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale against a background of continued economic growth, and (2) absolute decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough to prevent global warming over 1.5°C or 2°C, even under optimistic policy conditions. We conclude that green growth is likely to be a misguided objective, and that policymakers need to look toward alternative strategies. },

For this purpose, panel unit root tests are employed to improve power against univariate counterparts. Since cross section correlation is a distinct feature of the underlying panel data, results are based on various second generation panel unit root tests, which account for cross section dependence among units. If an unobserved common factor model is assumed for generating the observations, there is indication for both a common factor and idiosyncratic components driving the non-stationarity of hours worked. In addition, taking these results together, there is no indication of cointegration among the individual time series of hours worked.},

This paper uses a long-run restriction implied by a large class of real-business-cycle models--identifying permanent productivity shocks as shocks to the common stochastic trend in output, consumption, and investment--to provide new evidence on this question. Econometric tests indicate that this common-stochastic-trend/cointegration implication is consistent with postwar U.S. data. However, in systems with nominal variables, the estimates of this common stochastic trend indicate that permanent productivity shocks typically explain less than half of the business-cycle variability in output, consumption, and investment.

Factor efficiency is assumed to evolve according to an unobserved component model which has the form of a dynamic version of factor analysis and which nests most of the specifications for technology shocks used in the literature. We show under which conditions the processes generating the components can be identified from measurements of TFP only. We also discuss how additional information on the technology shocks can be obtained from the factor demand equations associated with the production technology. The methodology is applied to quarterly data for the manufacturing industry in the Netherlands 1971.1-1990.IV. Technology is found to be driven by a stochastic trend with a first order moving average part. This finding is similar to results obtained by Lippi and Reichlin (1994) among others; The findings for TFP corroborate earlier findings for the dynamic features of technology in labor and cpaital demand equations for the manufacturing industry in the Netherlands.},

The model assumes that government is subject to the golden rule of public finance and that households are finitely lived in the sense of Yaari–Blanchard. It is shown that the growth-maximizing tax rate is not equivalent to the welfare-maximizing one; in addition, both tax rates are lower than the output elasticity of public capital. This paper also derives the threshold value of public debt to GDP ratio that maximizes the equilibrium growth rate and social welfare, i.e., the inverted-U relation between the public debt to GDP ratio and the economic growth rate suggested by empirical studies. Furthermore, this paper shows that both tax rates and the public debt to GDP ratio positively depend on longevity. This result provides a possible explanation for the rising tendency of the public debt to GDP ratio under population aging in countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. },

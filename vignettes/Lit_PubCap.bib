@Book{Blyth2013,
	title = {Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea},
	author = {Blyth, Mark},
	year = {2013},
	publisher = {Oxford University Press},
	abstract = { Selected as a Financial Times Best Book of 2013 Governments today in both Europe and the United States have succeeded in casting government spending as reckless wastefulness that has made the economy worse. In contrast, they have advanced a policy of draconian budget cuts--austerity--to solve the financial crisis. We are told that we have all lived beyond our means and now need to tighten our belts. This view conveniently forgets where all that debt came from. Not from an orgy of government spending, but as the direct result of bailing out, recapitalizing, and adding liquidity to the broken banking system. Through these actions private debt was rechristened as government debt while those responsible for generating it walked away scot free, placing the blame on the state, and the burden on the taxpayer. That burden now takes the form of a global turn to austerity, the policy of reducing domestic wages and prices to restore competitiveness and balance the budget. The problem, according to political economist Mark Blyth, is that austerity is a very dangerous idea. First of all, it doesn't work. As the past four years and countless historical examples from the last 100 years show, while it makes sense for any one state to try and cut its way to growth, it simply cannot work when all states try it simultaneously: all we do is shrink the economy. In the worst case, austerity policies worsened the Great Depression and created the conditions for seizures of power by the forces responsible for the Second World War: the Nazis and the Japanese military establishment. As Blyth amply demonstrates, the arguments for austerity are tenuous and the evidence thin. Rather than expanding growth and opportunity, the repeated revival of this dead economic idea has almost always led to low growth along with increases in wealth and income inequality. Austerity demolishes the conventional wisdom, marshaling an army of facts to demand that we austerity for what it is, and what it costs us. },

To start with, there is often confusion about what public investment means in the first place, as much of the economic literature employs the terms ``public investment'' and ``infrastructure investment'' interchangeably. A great deal of public investment is not infrastructure investment, and a great deal of infrastructure investment is not public. As we will deal with the composition of public investment below, some examples of non-public infrastructure investment should suffice here. They include investment by energy companies in generation capacity; telecom companies in networks; or rail companies in rolling stock or rail track. In all these cases commercial enterprises finance these investments, which are recorded as investment of the enterprise sector in national accounts statistics---regardless of the ownership structure of the enterprises. Only investment directly financed from the budget of the government---at the central or sub-national level---qualifies as public investment. },

	abstract = { The sustainability of fiscal deficits has been receiving increasing attention. The issue is paramount for the newly formed euro area, and that is one of the motivations of this paper. In order to assess the sustainability of budget deficits, cointegration tests between public expenditures and public revenues, allowing for structural breaks, are performed for the EU-15 countries for the 1970-2003 period. The "unpleasant" empirical results show that with few exceptions fiscal policy may not have been sustainable. EU governments therefore may risk becoming inherently highly indebted, even though the debt-to-GDP ratios seemed to be somehow stabilizing at the end of the 1990s. },

We present a taxonomy for tracing the physical and transition impacts of climate change through to impacts on sovereign risk. We then apply the taxonomy to the UK’s potential transition to net zero. Meeting internationally agreed climate targets will require an unprecedented structural transformation of the global economy over the next two or three decades. The changing landscape of risks warrants new risk management and hedging strategies to contain climate risk and minimise the impact of asset stranding and asset devaluation. Yet, conditional on action being taken early, the opportunities from managing a net zero transition would substantially outweigh the costs. },

Panel data regressions are presented next; they show that higher innovation performance promotes growth directly, whereas public capital has both direct and indirect growth effects by promoting human capital accumulation and innovation capacity. Elasticity estimates derived from simultaneous equation techniques show that the general equilibrium effects of public capital on steady-state output per capita (which account for indirect effects) are significantly higher than those derived from single equation methods. },

These two problems are usually tackled separately in the policy agenda. A new breed of radical proposals have been advanced to manage a fair low-carbon transition. In this spirit, we develop a dynamic macrosimulation model to investigate the long-term effects of three scenarios: green growth, policies for social equity, and degrowth. The green growth scenario, based on technological progress and environmental policies, achieves a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of increasing income inequality and unemployment. The policies for social equity scenario adds direct labour market interventions that result in an environmental performance similar to green growth while improving social conditions at the cost of increasing public deficit. The degrowth scenario further adds a reduction in consumption and exports, and achieves a greater reduction in emissions and inequality with higher public deficit, despite the introduction of a wealth tax. We argue that new radical social policies can combine social prosperity and low-carbon emissions and are economically and politically feasible. },

Fiscal rules can be flexible, meaning that they include mechanisms to accommodate exogenous shocks (e.g., cyclically adjusted fiscal targets, well-defined escape clauses, and differential treatment of investment expenditures) or rigid, meaning they establish numerical limits on fiscal targets without taking into account flexible features. We find that in countries with either no fiscal rule or with a rigid fiscal rule, a fiscal consolidation of at least 2 percent of GDP is associated with an average 10 percent reduction in public investment. Instead, in countries with flexible fiscal rules, the negative effect of fiscal adjustments on public investment vanishes, which implies that flexible rules protect public investment during consolidation episodes. The corollary is that the design of fiscal rules can add a growth-friendliness dimension to the fiscal sustainability objective that has typically been the focus of fiscal rules in the past, provided public investment is productive. },

In a sample of more than 100 developing countries and 30 developed countries observed between 1980 and 2014, a new empirical regularity specific to developing countries is identified: upswings are associated with increases in current primary expenditures only, while public investment falls and current spending remains acyclical during downturns. Evidence is also presented that this asymmetrical response is more pronounced in countries where incumbent politicians face shorter time horizons and weak institutions. Other types of determinants traditionally discussed in the literature have limited explanatory power. },

Using meta-regression analysis, we show how study design characteristics and publication bias can explain a large fraction of the variation across estimates. We find a short-run output elasticity of public capital supplied at the central government level of 0.083, which increases to 0.122 in the long run. If, in addition, only core infrastructure at a regional/local level of government is considered, these estimates are almost doubled. The average output elasticity of public capital amounts to 0.106.

The main findings are threefold. First, governance quality is a key element to improve the value for money of public investment. This is the case both at the national and the sub-national level in all Member States analysed. Second, sub-national governments are at the forefront of public investment. Local governance, institutional arrangements and coordination across levels of governance are therefore key elements for the proper provision of public investment. Third, a sound institutional setup can support public investment. Strengthened fiscal rules can mitigate the depressionary effect of public debt on public investment. },

Using a panel time series approach and a large cross-country dataset, the paper estimates a long-run aggregate production function relating gross domestic product to human capital, physical capital, and a synthetic measure of infrastructure comprising transport, power and telecommunications. Tests of the cointegration rank allowing it to vary across countries reveal a common rank with a single cointegrating vector, which we interpret as the long-run production function. Estimation of its parameters is performed using the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator, which allows for unrestricted short-run parameter heterogeneity across countries while imposing the (testable) restriction of long-run parameter homogeneity. The long-run elasticity of output with respect to the synthetic infrastructure index ranges between 0.07 and 0.10. The estimates are highly significant, both statistically and economically, and robust to alternative dynamic specifications and infrastructure measures. Tests of parameter homogeneity fail to yield evidence that the long-run parameters differ across countries. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

The deviations from the stock equilibrium are not (trend) stationary, but I(1). Utilizing them in a model for investment flows improves the cointegration evidence between the I(1) variables. In fact, private investment flows, GDP and the real interest rate appear to be cointegrated only if the deviations from the stock equilibrium are included. The corresponding error correction equation is well behaved. Therefore, knowledge of the stock relationship is crucial to explain the changes in private investment flows. Overall, the lack of public investment may have restricted private investment and thus GDP growth in the euro area.

Since public capital is accumulated in tandem with the accumulation of private capital in the long-run from a historical perspective, it is quite natural that there is a positive relationship between private investment and public investment. However, some previous studies have provided evidence for the crowding-in effect of public investment on private investment while other studies have provided evidence for the crowding-out effect. What is the reason for these inconsistent results on the crowding-in effect? In order to answer this question, we will consider the possibility of analyzing the long-run relationship between private and public investment on the stock phase rather than the flow phase. Our empirical results show that there is a cointegration relationship between private capital and public capital. Accordingly, the relationship between private and public investment should be represented by an error correction mechanism designed to achieve a long-run stock equilibrium. Estimating the error correction model, we affirm the crowding-in effect of public investment on private investment.},

These difficulties are grounded in a limited understanding of the popular constraints during periods of fiscal pressure. For instance, an influential view claims that fiscal austerity does not entail significant political risk. But this research potentially underestimates the impact of austerity on votes because of strategic selection bias. This study addresses this challenge by conducting survey experiments in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the UK and Germany. In contrast to previous findings, the results show that a government's re-election chances greatly decrease if it proposes austerity measures. Voters object particularly strongly to spending cuts and, to a lesser extent, to tax increases. While voters also disapprove of fiscal deficits, they weight the costs of austerity policies more than their potential benefits for the fiscal balance. These findings are inconsistent with the policy recommendations of international financial institutions. },

We demonstrate for a panel of 19 OECD countries between 1971 and 2007 that the share of elderly people and public investment rates are cointegrated, indicating a long-run relationship between them. Estimating this cointegration relationship via dynamic OLS (DOLS) we find a negative and significant effect of population aging on public investment. Moreover, the estimation of an error correction model reveals long-run Granger causality running exclusively from aging to investment.

To this end, we expand time series on public capital stocks for 20 OECD countries and estimate country-specific recursive vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Results show that the effect of public capital shocks on economic growth has not increased in general, although results differ widely between countries. This suggests that the current level of public investments generally does not pose an immediate threat to potential output. Of course, this could change if low investment levels are sustained for a long time. }

This paper estimates the dynamic domestic effects of public infrastructure using a structural vector autoregressive (S-VAR) methodology for the Spanish regions. From a methodological point of view, the paper contains several features that can be viewed as a contribution to the existing empirical literature. First, the important issues of the stationarity of the data and the existence and estimation of cointegrating relationships in the long-run are addressed in the context of the analysis of panel data. Secondly, the long-run cointegrating production function is embedded within structural vector error correction (S-VEC) shortrun models to produce consistent estimates of impulse responses, contrary to many researchers who have estimated unrestricted VAR models in levels or VAR models in first differences. The estimates reveal new results with respect to the previous empirical evidence. },

We explicitly allow for the possibility of announcement effects, i.e., that a current fiscal policy shock changes fiscal policy variables in the future, but not at present. We construct the impulse responses to three linear combinations of these fiscal shocks, corresponding to the three scenarios of deficit-spending, deficit-financed tax cuts and a balanced budget spending expansion. We apply the method to US quarterly data from 1955 to 2000. We find that deficit-financed tax cuts work best among these three scenarios to improve GDP, with a maximal present value multiplier of five dollars of total additional GDP per each dollar of the total cut in government revenue 5 years after the shock. },

Drawing from a panel data set of 29 Chinese provinces over the period 1985–2012, it constructs a synthetic infrastructure index and employs panel time series techniques. The findings suggest that infrastructure is, on average, a strong determinant of economic growth and that there are provincial differences in the marginal productivity of infrastructure due probably to differences in the relative shortage or overprovision of infrastructure stocks. Therefore, policy makers should use infrastructure investment as a means of boosting output or promoting regional development only to the extent that it does not lead to oversupply of infrastructure. },

We first survey the channels through which public capital can conceivably affect growth. We then turn to reviewing the existing empirical literature, and we conclude that although not all studies find a growth-enhancing effect of public capital, there is now more consensus than in the past that public capital furthers economic growth. However, the impact reported by recent studies is not as big as some earlier studies suggested. We conclude with an overview of what is known about the optimality of public capital stocks.

It also discusses OECD estimates of productivity levels and the key measurement issues in deriving these estimates, including the appropriate conversion from one currency unit to another. A final section discusses the interpretation of productivity measures, including their most common applications and the possible pitfalls. The paper concludes that substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve the comparability of productivity statistics. In many countries, however, basic source data are still the key limitation to the development of comparable indicators of productivity. In addition, statisticians, researchers and policy makers need to be more aware of the appropriate uses and interpretation of productivity statistics.},

In terms of the research and development agenda for productivity statistics, Schreyer identifies four priorities: better price indices for output measures by industry, particularly for high technology industries and difficult-to-measure services industries; better data on hours worked by industry; improvement in the quality of data on capital input; and improved input-output tables.},

Two main hypotheses have been posed to explain this evolution: (i) the ‘social dominance hypothesis’, whereby increased public social spending has been displacing investment from government’s budgets, despite the upward trend witnessed in tax burdens and debt; (ii) fiscal rules’ frameworks, that would have forced governments to reduce investment in their quest for compliance. In this paper, we jointly test the validity of these two duelling explanations using two empirical approaches (panel data models; local projections) for a sample of advanced economies comprising data for the past six decades. We find that both factors are relevant to explain the observed downward trend in investment, with social spending acting as a structural driver, whereas fiscal rules contributed mainly when applied in fiscal consolidation episodes.},

The golden rule would exempt public (net) investment suitably defined from the relevant deficit targets of both the preventative and the corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact as well as the Fiscal Compact. That way, fiscal policy would be upgraded and would receive more room for manoeuvre and public investment as a particularly growth-enhancing public expenditure category would be strengthened. Different definitions are discussed and a pragmatic definition based on the national accounts with some modifications will be proposed. The standard reservations against a golden rule are critically assessed and mostly discarded. Although a proper implementation would need some time, this should not be an excuse for not using pragmatic short-term solutions that are readily available at the European level. },

The results from our estimations point to both public and private capital having a positive effect on the long-run economic growth of the countries in our sample. However, the results also point to public capital seeming to crowd private capital in the short run, which could consequently be one of the explanations for the adverse effect that public capital stock seems to have on growth. (A result which was also found in the short-run analysis.) These findings suggest that governments in Latin America and the Caribbean should continue to support public and private investment projects, given the positive effect that both types of capital seem to have on the long-run economic growth of these countries. However, some changes should be made in the planning and execution of such investments in order to avoid some undesirable effects that seem to exist, especially in the short run. },

Potential endogeneity concerns are addressed by employing generalized method of moments estimators that utilize internal instruments. We find that the interaction terms between infrastructure capital and institutional quality show a positive and significant impact on economic growth. These results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications and institutional quality measures. Hence, our results suggest that maximizing returns from infrastructure capital requires improving the quality of institutions. },

Our findings confirm those of our earlier paper. In particular, GDP multipliers of government purchases are larger in recession, and controlling for real-time predictions of government purchases tends to increase the estimated multipliers of government purchases in recession. We also consider the responses of other key macroeconomic variables and find that these responses generally vary over the cycle as well, in a pattern consistent with the varying impact on GDP.},

Our analysis suggests that spillovers of fiscal policy shocks in the Euro Area are small. Overall, spending multipliers are higher than revenue-based multipliers and are in line with those found in the literature. We find that, during the crisis, fiscal stimulus packages increased annualized quarter-on-quarter GDP growth substantially, both in Germany and in the rest of the Euro Area. The main drivers of GDP growth in Europe, however, were rest of the world and uncovered interest rate parity shocks, followed by domestic non-fiscal shocks.},

	abstract = { This paper presents new estimates for 21 OECD countries covering the period 1960-2001, focusing on two questions: To what extent does the impact of public capital on output differ across countries? And to what extent does it differ over time? Using vector autoregressions (VARs), we find that in some countries a shock to public capital has a positive long-run impact on GDP while in others the longrun impact is zero or even negative. We also find that variability of public capital and its long-run impact on output are negatively correlated. Furthermore, when the public capital stock is large relative to the private capital stock the long-run impact of public capital is lower. Our results on 'recursive' VARs suggest that in the majority of countries the effect of a public-capital shock on output has decreased over time. Countries where the impact of public capital decreased during the 1990s have a declining public-capital-to-GDP ratio, and vice versa. Estimates based on a panel VAR for the OECD area confirm the declining long-run impact of public capital. },

We start with a brief overview of recent developments in public investments, including some methodological issues, and provide a literature overview of the effect of public investments on growth. On the basis of updated estimates of the public capital stock, we estimate the output response to a public capital impulse, using VAR models. In addition, using a structural model, we investigate the sensitivity of the macroeconomic impact of an increase in public investments to alternative assumptions about economic structures and policy implementations.

	abstract = { The empirical literature using vector autoregressive models to assess the effects of fiscal policy shocks strongly disagrees on even the qualitative response of key macroeconomic variables to government spending and tax shocks. We provide new evidence for the U.S. over the period 1955-2006. We show that, controlling for differences in specification of the reduced-form model, all identification approaches used in the literature yield qualitatively and quantitatively very similar results as regards government spending shocks. In response to such shocks real GDP, real private consumption and the real wage all significantly increase following a hump-shaped pattern, while private employment does not react. In contrast, we find strongly diverging results as regards the effects of tax shocks, with the estimated effects ranging from non-distortionary to strongly distortionary. The di¤erences in results can to a large extent be traced back to differences in the size of automatic stabilizers estimated or calibrated for alternative identification approaches. These differences also translate into uncertainty about the effects of policy experiments typically considered in theoretical models. JEL Classification: C32, E60, E62, H20, H5 },

	abstract = {We investigate the long run consequences of infrastructure provision on per capita income in a panel of countries over the period 1950-1992. Simple panel based tests are developed which enable us to isolate the sign and direction of the long run effect of infrastructure on income in a manner that is robust to the presence of unknown heterogeneous short run causal relationships. Our results provide clear evidence that in the vast majority of cases infrastructure does induce long run growth effects. But we also find a great deal of variation in the results across individual countries. Taken as a whole, the results demonstrate that telephones, electricity generating capacity and paved roads are provided at close to the growth maximizing level on average, but are under-supplied in some countries and over-supplied in others. These results also help to explain why cross section and time series studies have in the past found contradictory results regarding a causal link between infrastructure provision and long run growth.},

Following the introduction, section 2 discusses the theoretical foundations (growth theory and new economic geography). Section 3 assesses the analysis of 140 specifications from 64 recent empirical papers-examining type of data used, level of aggregation, econometric techniques and nature of the sample-and discusses both the macro-econometric and micro-econometric contributions of these papers. Finally section 4 discusses directions for future research and suggests priorities in data development.},

	abstract = {It is often claimed that the introduction of the EU rules-based fiscal framework of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact was responsible for a decline in public investment shares in EU countries. Proposals have also been made in recent times in favour of a revision of the EU fiscal framework in such a way to grant special treatment to public capital expenditures (e.g., by amending it with a â€˜golden rule'). This paper analyses empirically the relation between the introduction of the EU fiscal framework and public investment. Results from panel data analysis suggest that the impact of the EU rules for fiscal discipline is not a clear-cut one. On the one hand, after phase II of EMU, public investment is found to be more negatively affected by debt levels. This is consistent with the view that in the run-up to Maastricht the budgetary adjustment implied a significant decline in public investment, especially in high-debt countries. On the other hand, results indicate that after phase II of EMU public investment became positively related to previous period budget balances, so that the improvement in the budget balances consequent to the introduction of the EU fiscal rules may have helped to create room for public investment in several EU countries.},
